# GEO_RMEAN_Data
Scripts to extract RMEAN Data from Gene Omnibus Profile data
This file is developed as a bash file using shell language
There are two files needed to process the required count data
The main file is Geo_profile_simpler_analysis.sh
The run file needed to extract the data runs within the main file and it is Geo_profile_script.sh
Both files should be kept in the same directory alongside data files downloaded from Gene Omnibus
Two Tables will be created, one for normalized count data and another for Raw count data
